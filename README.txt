This project was developed as an artefact for my dissertation.

It explores the implementation and relevance of scientifiically accurate N-Body gravitational siimulations, enhanced by using the Barnes-Hut algorithm, in a videogame setting.

This application includes an interactive main menu, sandbox-style "test "scene, as well as an example game scene.
